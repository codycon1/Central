# Central
A repo of little projects - a scratchpad of sorts

This repository, central, is my personal learning scratchpad. It's a place where I experiment with new concepts I'm currently studying.

This repo serves as a living portfolio, 

Feel free to browse, and if you have any questions about the code or my learning journey, don't hesitate to reach out.
